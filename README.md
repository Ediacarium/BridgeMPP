BridgeMPP: Platform independent messaging
=========
About BridgeMPP:
=========
BridgeMPP is a messaging server that enables users to message with users from other messaging protocols without requiring the user to register on every service. It does so by using a client for every messaging service and forwarding received messages to other clients on other messaging services based on a group system.
BridgeMPP currently supports messaging over Console, TCP Sockets, E-Mail, Skype, Whatsapp, XMPP (including Facebook, League of Legends, and other XMPP based services). Thus a BridgeMPP server allows clients from inside a service (such as XMPP) to talk to clients on any other service (such as Whatsapp). BridgeMPP requires an account for every service that the server runs.
